# Product-Similarity
This Project Deployed for Increasing Factory Efficiency by promoting the Concept of special proficiency gain through similar repetitive work process.

## Methodology
🧵 Study past trends of SST Loadings Since 2022 In SFCG.

🧵 Examine SST distributions over modules throughout years.

🧵 Examine line gap days.

🧵 Analyse SST categories and form Silhouette for Planning purpose.

🧵 Anticipate SST loadings season wise proactively.

🧵 Coordinate with the merchandizing and Planning teams to get advance bulk details.

🧵 Load SST in Systematic approach.

🧵 Load most dominant SST label in Same module.

🧵 SST variations loaded as optimizing similarities and Delivery dates.

🧵 Propose New Efficiency ladder based upon similarity scores.
Assume order Quantity as 4600 pcs
Previous ladder : <img width="1340" height="82" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fefd6f05-f1b6-4382-b917-a967d11f3c1d" />
Proposed ladder : <img width="1206" height="81" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2302a42b-4f53-4b7a-be53-fac5775513c6" />

🧵 Coordinate with supporting functions for continuous improvements(Technical, mechanical).
