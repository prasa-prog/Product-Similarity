# Product-Similarity
This Project Deployed for Increasing Factory Efficiency by promoting the Concept of special proficiency gain through similar repetitive work process.

## Methodology
ðŸ§µ Studied past trends of SST Loadings Since 2022 In SFCG.

ðŸ§µ Examined SST distributions over modules throughout years.

ðŸ§µ Examined line gap days.

ðŸ§µ Analysed SST categories and form Silhouette for Planning purpose.

ðŸ§µ Anticipated SST loadings season wise proactively.

ðŸ§µ Coordinated with the merchandizing and Planning teams to get advance bulk details.

ðŸ§µ Loaded SST in Systematic approach.

ðŸ§µ Loaded most dominant SST label in Same module.

ðŸ§µ SST variations loaded as optimizing similarities and Delivery dates.

ðŸ§µ Proposed New Efficiency ladder based upon similarity scores.
Assume order Quantity as 4600 pcs
Previous ladder : <img width="1340" height="82" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fefd6f05-f1b6-4382-b917-a967d11f3c1d" />
Proposed ladder : <img width="1206" height="81" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2302a42b-4f53-4b7a-be53-fac5775513c6" />

ðŸ§µ Coordinated with supporting functions for continuous improvements(Technical, mechanical).
